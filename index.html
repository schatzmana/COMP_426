A team name (if you want to name your team)
A title for your final project
A description of your final project. It would be nice if you could expand on the description you provide to the form above but that will do in a pinch.
Links to the various interface mock-ups with a short description of the functionality and role each interface is expected to play in the overall project.

			<h1>Description of your final project: </h1>
			Our project is going to be a craigslist-type website, where users can log on to sell and buy items. There will be a home page, from which you can then go to a Create a Post page,
			which will be a form where you can input what you are selling, category, price, and a description. Users will be required to log in before they can create a post. Users can then go onto
			a page where they will be able to view all of their past posts and delete their posts. We will also have a Results page where everyone can see every single post that has been made.
			We hope to be able to sort these results based on category, price, and other attributes. Our posts, usernames, and categories will all be stored in a relational database that we will
			retrieve all of our data from.

      <p>Here are our mockup pages, with their descriptions on the individual pages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <a href="mockup_home.html">home page</a></li>
        <li> <a href="mockup_create.html">create a post</a></li>
        <li> <a href="mockup_allposts.html">all the posts</a></li>
      </ul>
